# Forks
Either fork the original repository or create a new branch on this repo to work on your weekly progress. Whatever is convenient for you.


# How to create Issues:

- Press on the `Issues` tab and then press `New issue`.
- Select labels to describe the issue to other team members. Please take note of the differences between each label and what they stand for.
- Choose a meaningful title. If the issues is about something that's to be done later on in the project or regarding our git repository - add `TODO`.
- If the issue deals with bug/feature improvent, provide code snippet so other team members get proper understanding of the problem. To copy multiple lines go to the relevant 
 file and press on the intended row line, hold shift and then press on another row line. This section will be colored in yellow and you should be able to copy that section to the new issue.
- If you have suggestions about how to fix the bug or how to improve code, provide detailed explanation and steps using markdown.
- Use markdown to make your message clearer. </br>

  - Comment : general feedback without explicit approval of merge.
